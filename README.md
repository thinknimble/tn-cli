## ThinkNimble CLI

Convenient and sharable command-line tools for nimble thinkers.

## How It Works

TN CLI uses a command runner tool called `just` (https://github.com/casey/just), which similar to `make`, but is "Just a Command Runner" as opposed to a build system.

## Installation

```sh
curl -fsSL https://nimbl.sh/install | bash
```

After installing, restart your terminal.

## Usage

Now try out the `tn` command. Type `tn` and press the `â†µ Enter` key. You should see a list of "Available Recipes." like this:

```sh
Available recipes:
    os-info

    [aws]
    aws-enable-bedrock project_name profile='default' region='us-east-1' model='*'
    aws-make-s3-bucket project_name profile='default' region='us-east-1'

    [bootstrapper]
    new-project
    bootstrap   # alias for `new-project`

    # etc...
```

## Bash and Zsh Tab Completions

The install script above attempts to automatically install Bash and Zsh completions. This will auto-complete commands when you press `Tab`.

While this install seems to work consistently on Mac with Zsh, we have had less luck with bash completions on Linux (Ubuntu). If that is your case and you are not getting tab-completions, try adding the following to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# TN-CLI
export TNCLI_DIR="$HOME/.tn/cli"
alias tn='just -f ~/.tn/cli/justfile -d .'
[ -s "$TNCLI_DIR/completions/bash-completions/tncli" ] && \. "$TNCLI_DIR/completions/bash-completions/tncli"
```

Then reload your shell or `source ~/.bashrc`.

### Ollama as a local LLM
Use `tn update-config` <arg> <arg> to set a basic config the default for the local ollama is http://localhost:11434. You should be setting 

```
OLLAMA_API_URL="http://localhost:11434"
OLLAMA_MODEL="llama3.3"
```

- `tn ollama-serve`: serve a local llm server this is needed to run any commands
- `tn ollama-pull`: When working locally if you want to try a model you have to pull it 
- `tn ollama-run`: Run an interactive chat with the local ollama server

                  `--model=""` use a custom model the default is qwen2.5-coder:7b


## Contributing New Commands - aka "Recipes"

It's easy to contribute new commands to tn-cli, simply add some commands to the `justfile` and open a Pull Request.

Check out the [Quick Start](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start) documentation to learn the syntax for `just` commands (aka "recipes"). Commands can be written for just about any OS and language. For example, you can write Python scripts directly in the `justfile`. This makes for an ideal wrapper around other CLI tools.

NOTE: You will probably want to install a just syntax highlighter for your editor. For VSCode, search the extension marketplace for "just."
